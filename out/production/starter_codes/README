1. for every instance: :%s/fun/amazing/g
   for first instance: :s/fun/amazing

   find all the java file in current directory
4. open files in vim: >vim *.java

5. static keyword means that static variables or methods can be accessed
   withoud requiring an instantiation of the class to which they belong.
   for example:
   public class Cat {
	int steps;
	public static int move() {
		steps = steps + 1;
	}
}
   //in another class using move method
     int catMove = move();
6. We can regard ShapeDrawer class as parent class which contains common 
   instant variables and methods for drawing Square with different colors.
   Then we can creat several subclass like RedCircle,BlueCircle,YelloSquare
   GreenSquare and so on that are inherited from parent class ShapeDrawer.
   In each subclass we can override the methods in the parent class to meet
   the specific requirement.
